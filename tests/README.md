# Pathfinding Agent Framework & Classical Optimization Benchmarks

## Overview
This repository serves as a testbed for **classical search algorithms** (A*, BFS) applied to **geospatial navigation** in grid-based environments. 

The project is currently evolving into a hybrid AI framework that compares classical deterministic pathfinding against **LLM-based Agentic navigation** to measure the effectiveness of Large Language Models in spatial reasoning and wargaming problem spaces.

## Features
* **Classical Optimizers:** Implementation of A* (A-Star) with Manhattan distance heuristics and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
* **Geospatial Simulation:** Grid-based map parsing simulating traversable terrain, obstacles, and variable movement costs.
* **Heuristic Analysis:** Modular heuristic architecture to test different distance metrics.

## Roadmap (In Progress)
* **LLM Agent Integration:** wrapping the simulation environment to allow LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3) to "reason" through pathfinding without explicit algorithms.
* **Evaluation Engine:** Building tooling to benchmark LLM spatial performance against the optimal paths generated by the A* baseline.
* **Metric Analysis:** Comparing token usage, path optimality, and wall-clock time between classical and generative approaches.

## Usage
Run the main solver on a map file:
```bash
python src/main.py data/map1.txt
